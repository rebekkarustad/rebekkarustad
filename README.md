# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Rebekka Rustad. I am a front-end developer from Oslo, Norway. I am finishing my Higher Professional Degree at Noroff School of technology and digital media this year, and I am ready for new adventures.

I have always been fascinated by problem-solving, and I started with simple HTML and CSS all the way back in 2008 by redesigning all my friends' blogs.

### Things I like:
- Traveling
- Watch movies
- Reading good books
